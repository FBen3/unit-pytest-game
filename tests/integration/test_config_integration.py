# Validation of Configuration Loading: Ensure that your application can correctly read and parse the configuration file.
# This includes handling missing files, incorrect formats, or missing sections/keys gracefully.
#
#
# Integration Tests (integration/): If your tests involve reading from an actual config.ini
# file or a test version of this file to see how config.py integrates with the file system
# and how other parts of your application respond to these loaded configurations,
# these tests would be more suited to the integration/ directory.
