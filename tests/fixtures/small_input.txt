edge cases:

1. Single Bid Just Meeting Reserve Price:
    If only one bid is placed and it exactly meets the reserve price, the bidder should win the auction at the reserve
    price, according to the rules. This situation tests the handling of auctions with a minimal number of bids.

2. Bids Below Reserve Price:
    If all bids are below the reserve price, the item should remain unsold. This scenario checks how the system handles
    auctions where interest does not meet the seller's minimum expectation.

3. Multiple Bids at the Same Highest Amount:
    If multiple bids are placed at the same highest amount, the earliest bid at that amount should win, but the price
    paid is an interesting consideration if the second-highest bid is of a different value or also the same.

4. Bids with the Same Amount from the Same User:
    A user might bid the same amount more than once, with the expectation that only the first bid counts as valid
    based on the rules. The system needs to ignore subsequent identical bids from the same user when considering
    the winning and second-highest bids.

5. Late Bids:
    Bids received after the auction's closing time should be invalid, even if they're higher than all previous bids.
    Handling the exact closing time boundary (bids arriving precisely at the closing time) is crucial.

6. Early Bids:
    Bids placed before the auction starts are clearly invalid but handling them properly (especially if they're
    timestamped exactly at the start time) is necessary for consistency.

7. No Bids:
    When no bids are placed for an auction, the item remains unsold. This case tests the system's ability to handle
    auctions with no participant interest.

8. Decreasing Bid Amounts from the Same User:
    A user might place a higher bid and then try to place a lower bid. According to the rules, the lower bid should
    be considered invalid since it's not larger than the user's previous valid bid.

9. Multiple Auctions for the Same Item:
    If the system somehow allows the same item to be listed in more than one auction simultaneously or before the
    previous auction concludes, it could create conflicts regarding which auction the bids apply to and how to handle
    the item's sale status.

10. Edge Case in Bid Increments:
    The rules don't specify minimum bid increments. So, if there's a very small increment above the second-highest
    bid (e.g., $0.01), it could lead to scenarios where the winning bid is only marginally higher than the
    second-highest bid, affecting the final price paid.

11. Handling Ties in Bid Submission Time:
    In a digital system, it's conceivable (though rare) that two bids could be timestamped identically,
    especially in systems with lower resolution clocks. Determining which bid is considered "earlier" in such a
    case would need clear rules.

Addressing these edge cases in the auction system's design and implementation would be crucial for ensuring fair and predictable outcomes for both buyers and sellers.
