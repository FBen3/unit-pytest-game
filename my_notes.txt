- zip solution (wtf does "checked out and built" mean??)
- program should take (path) input file (as a CLI argument)
- third-party packages can only be used during testing (e.g. pytest)

summary: suppose you're running an auction ... ok ... people post / bid on items ...

notes:
- "at the end of each auction, of there are bids *meeting* or in *excess* of the reserve price, the highest bidder wins
the item."
  -- "however, the winner pays the *second highest* *valid bid*"
  -- if there is only 1 bid, winner pays *reserve price*

valid bid: 1. arrives AFTER auction start & BEFORE auction end time
           2. larger than any previous valid bid submitted by the person

- if 2 equal bids are received, the earliest wins

---

- look into whether code follows PEP8 and how that is checked (particularly here in PyCharm)
- look into Black formatter
- look into pylint (how to use pylist to disable false positives, wtv the fuck that means)
- TODO: check the selling user doesn't/can't bid on his/her own item
