Assumptions:

- All source code, including tests are located inside 
- `Python 3.10` was used during development & testing
- Testing framework: `Pytest`
- Program expects a user supplied path to an input file
- Optional `-s`,`--save` flag to persist database between runs
- Program can be run from anywhere [!!! make sure this is true !!!]

Quickstart:

- **Run**: 
- **Run test suite**: 
- **Run unit tests**: 
- **Run a group of tests**:

Observations:
